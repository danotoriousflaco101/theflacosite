This is just my portfolio. 

The idea is to showcase my skills in HTML5, CSS and soon JavaScript as well in an active manner. 
The project is still a little bit raw, all files were created and collected in the same directory. I've started developing from scratches in 2022. I'm planning to update the site soon with more content and updates about skills and implementing also some back end feature as well. (Skate Map project)
